        <p>I am a Spanish 25 year old man, who recently moved to Sweden for personal and professional reasons. I am passionate about technology,
          language learning, traveling and programming. In my free time I like to enjoy a nice walk in nature, go canooing, meeting friends for dinner
          and attending cultural events such as art expositions and concerts. I am also very sociable; that's why, once a week, I attend a language café
          where I practice my Swedish or French while meeting new people. It's not rare to find me sitting in a coffeshop reading a book, studying,
          or simply looking out of the window observing the street and daydreaming. I am currently looking
          forward to <b>finding an exciting internship</b> in Frontend Development. </p>
        </div>
        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="education">

          <p>I graduated in European Languages in 2015 at the University of Zaragoza, in Spain. I studied French, English and German as well as the literature,
            culture and history related to these languages. I specialised on translation and French literature of the 19th and 20th centuries.
            However, I had always had a strong interest in technology that grew stronger with the years and after moving to Sweden, I decided to study programming. Currently,
            I am studying to become a Frontend Developer at EC Utbildning in Göteborg, Sweden.The education consists of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Angular, AJAX, React
            and Server-side programming (PHP).</p>

          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="work">

            <p>As soon as I started university, I developed a strong wish to be independent and work. That's what drove me to start working during my studies. I
              started working part-time at McDonald's during my studies and kept this job for the last three years of university. After this, I took my little savings,
              and my strong wish to start a new life and moved to a big city, Barcelona. Here I was able to know what a full-time office job is like, how it feels to
              to be only dependent on yourself and tasted, for the first time, the freedom and responsibility of an adult's life. My first job there was in the
              of tourism and traveling, as a trilingual Travel Customer Service Agent. As soon as I could, I found a job more suitable to my interest in technology. I
              took up new responsibilities and learned a great deal about informatics as a bilingual Level 2 IT Helpdesk. After I moved to Sweden, I joined a program
              in Frontend Development and I am now looking for an <b>internship in Web Development</b> to put a foot in the field and maybe even in the company where
              I would do my internship.
